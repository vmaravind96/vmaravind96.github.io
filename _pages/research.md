        <h4><a href="#">Modelling Controllers for Cyber Physical Systems using Neural Networks</a></h4>
        <h6>Independent Study - Fall 2022</h6>
        <p><b>Advisor:</b> Prof. Sriram Sankaranarayanan</p>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li>Explored approaches for adopting a neural network in a control based setup.</li>
                <li>Implemented two Imitation Learning approaches namely <b>Behavioral Cloning</b> and 
                <b>DataSet Aggregation</b>(DaGGER)</li>
                <li>Conducted experiments and observed the performance of the above approaches using <b>Bicycle robot</b> and <b>Caltech Ducted Fan</b> benchmarks.</li>

        <h6>Independent Study - Spring 2022</h6>
        <p><b>Advisor:</b> Prof. Geena Kim</p>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li>Explored novel architectures and approaches for efficiently segmenting brain tumors as a part of BraTS challenge.</li>
                <li>In depth analysis of why existing approach using <b>Deep InfoMax</b> was not able to achieve better results in    comparison with a standard U-net based architecture.</li>
                <li>Explored Deep Medic and 3D-Unet architectures for segmentation tasks.</li>
                <li>Implemented <b>multi-scale dense U-net</b> (MDU-net) architecture which was able to achieve promising results.</li>

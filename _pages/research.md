        <h4><a href="#">Modelling Controllers for Cyber Physical Systems using Neural Networks</a></h4>
        <h6>Independent Study - Fall 2022</h6>
        <p><b>Advisor:</b> Prof. Sriram Sankaranarayanan</p>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li> Investigated methods for successfully training neural networks in a control-based environment, such as trajectory tracking.</li>
                <li> Implemented <b>Behavioral Cloning</b> and <b>DataSet Aggregation (DaGGER)</b>, two imitation learning techniques, to efficiently train neural networks.</li>
                <li> Conducted tests and evaluated the effectiveness of the aforementioned strategies using the Bicycle robot and Caltech Ducted Fan benchmarks.</li>

        <h4><a href="#">Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS)</a></h4>
        <h6>Independent Study - Spring 2022</h6>
        <p><b>Advisor:</b> Prof. Geena Kim</p>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li>  As part of the BraTS challenge, explored novel techniques and techniques for effectively segmenting brain tumors.</li>
                <li> In-depth examination of the reasons why the current Deep InfoMax strategy failed to outperform a traditional U-net-based architecture.</li>
                <li> Adopted the multi-scale dense U-net (MDU-net) architecture, which produced encouraging outcomes.</li>

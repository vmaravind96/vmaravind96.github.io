I am currently pursuing my second year of Master's in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

My research interests are in the field of Cyber Physical Systems and I am currently working with <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/">Prof. Sriram Sankaranarayanan</a> 
on modelling controllers for Cyber Physical Systems using Neural networks. 

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at Coimbatore Institute of Technology, India in 2018. After my undergrad, I worked as a Software Developer for 3 years in two startups namely <a href="https://soroco.com/">Soroco</a> and <a href="https://www.zomentum.com/">Zomentum</a>.  

**Hobbies**: Reading books (fantasy and fiction), cooking and watching movies
